# Project files for Udemy Javascript course

These are the correctly added and linked repo for my Udemy javacript course designed by Jonas Schmedtmann. After much trial and error and googling.
I correctly linked my project file from my local machine to my GitHub account using Git. :)

There is a README1.md file as well, which is Jonas Schmedtmann's. As I do not in any way want to claim full credit for these courses and projects, although I did implement and code the logic myself on my journey to a Front-End Web Developer.
